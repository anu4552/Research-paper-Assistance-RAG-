🤖 What does this project do?

This project is an AI-powered research assistant that helps users read, understand, compare, and analyze multiple research papers automatically.Instead of manually reading long PDFs, the user can upload papers and ask questions in natural language — and the system gives accurate answers with citations.


🔹 Main Functions of the Project
1️⃣ Upload Multiple PDFs

User uploads many research papers at once.

👉 Example:

Paper1.pdf
Paper2.pdf
SurveyPaper.pdf

2️⃣ Understand & Index the Papers

The system:

Extracts text
     |
Breaks into chunks

Converts into vectors (embeddings)

Stores in vector database (FAISS)

👉 This allows fast semantic search
3️⃣ Ask Questions in Natural Language

User can ask:

What is the main contribution of this paper?

Compare methodologies of paper 1 and 2

What datasets were used?

Generate literature review

4️⃣ AI Generates Accurate Answers

The system:

Finds relevant content

Uses LLM to generate answer

Shows exact source + page number

👉 This avoids hallucination.

5️⃣ Advanced Features

✅ Multi-paper comparison
✅ Automatic summarization
✅ Literature review generation
✅ Citation tracking
✅ Semantic search
